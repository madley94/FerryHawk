                <h3>Why FerryHawk</h3>
                <p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic and subsequent loss of thousands of jobs within aviation, this lead to a more serious look at the world of aircraft ferrying – while many excellent established companies exist in the sector. Generally a lot of ferry pilots are hired for jobs through Facebook or LinkedIn posts – leading to a first come first served job market, of course a pilot needs to be qualified. But what if the process could be made more transparent and crews hired on merit.

                    That’s where FerryHawk hopes to come in.
                    
                    We are developing an online and mobile platform where owners can list jobs, and then pilots bid for trips – the trip owner will then be able to select their crew based upon merit, experience and cost. More transparency for the operator, while enabling the safest pilots to prosper.
                    
                    Additionally, allowing clear flexibility for part time ferry pilots who may spend the majority of their time flying for an airline or cargo operator.
